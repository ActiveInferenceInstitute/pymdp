    "### During policy evaluation / multi-step EFE integration, we need to tie together counterfactual beliefs about current location (imaginations about what my CURRENT location will be at t + tau) to counterfactual beliefs about previous location (imaginations about what my PREVIOUS location will be at t + tau). In order to do that, the idea is that we keep the hidden state factors statistically independent (B[0] does not depend on B[1]), but the space of allowable policies is reduced, such that if you're e.g. moving to Location 1 along hidden state factor 0, you can only move to consistent locations along hidden state factor 1. So like if the action along Hidden state factor 0 (current location) is \"Move to Location 1\", then policies that include that action can only have actions along Hidden state factor 1 (previous location) that are consistent with Location 1 being Current Location.
