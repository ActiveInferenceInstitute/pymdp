Welcome to pymdp's documentation!
=================================

**pymdp** is a Python package for simulating active inference agents in
discrete state-spaces and discrete time, using partially-observed Markov Decision Processes
(POMDPs) as a generative model class. The package is designed to be modular and flexible, to
enable users to design and simulate bespoke active inference models with varying levels of
specificity to a given task.
